# Numerical-Lineaire-Algebra

Project done together with @wardkerkhofs

> Numerical linear algebra is really function analysis, but with the emphasis always on practical algorithmic ideas rather then mathematical technicalities. -- Trefethen & Bau

This projects provides a comprehensive exploration of numerical techniques in linear algebra, with a focus on practical implementation using MATLAB. Topics include Chebyshev approximations, orthogonal polynomial bases construction for approximation, interpolation using Chebyshev zeros, and various orthogonalization methods such as Repeated Gram-Schmidt and Regular Gram-Schmidt. Emphasis is placed on understanding the numerical stability of the varous algorithms inplementing these concepts.
